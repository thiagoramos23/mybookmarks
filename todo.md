## TODO:

- [X] Add pagination
- [X] Add types (this means that we will have blog/article/bookmarks/read_it_later)
- [X] Change the UI so we can have multiple tabs? or panes? or lists? for each type.
- [ ] Add possibility for the user to create more types
- [ ] Add labels so we can search by them
- [ ] Add a Quick add functionality where I can add to a quick added type and later 
      can go there and send to the correct buckets
